Modus user interface framework | Spencer Tipping
Licensed under the terms of the MIT source code license

Modus is an abstraction layer on top of Caterwaul designed to make it easy to
write simple interfaces and possible to write complex ones. It manages a lot of
the tedium of user interface development while giving you lots of freedom to
customize.

Note that this framework isn't a widget library. It doesn't exist to solve that
problem. Rather, it's a way to rapidly compose existing components into
high-level structures. (Not that you couldn't write widgets using Modus; it's
just that the project doesn't come with many.)
